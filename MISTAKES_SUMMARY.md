# 🎯 Mistakes Tracking System - Summary

## What Has Been Created

Your fan2quizz project now includes a complete mistakes tracking system to help you improve at Quizypedia!

### New Scripts

1. **`scripts/track_mistakes.py`**
   - Extracts mistakes from current quiz session
   - Generates reports for today's quiz only

2. **`scripts/accumulate_mistakes.py`**
   - Builds historical database of ALL mistakes
   - Prevents duplicates
   - Shows progress over time

3. **`scripts/process_quiz.py`** ⭐ (Recommended)
   - One-command workflow
   - Runs parse_results.py + accumulate_mistakes.py automatically

### Output Files

All files are in your project root and are excluded from git (private data):

- **`mistakes_log.md`** - Chronological list of all mistakes
- **`mistakes_by_category.md`** - Mistakes grouped by topic (shows weak areas!)
- **`mistakes_history.json`** - Master database (all sessions)
- **`mistakes_log.json`** - Current session only

### Documentation

- **`MISTAKES_GUIDE.md`** - Complete usage guide with tips
- **`README.md`** - Updated with mistakes tracking section

## Quick Start

After completing your daily quiz:

```bash
# Option 1: Everything in one command (recommended)
uv run scripts/process_quiz.py

# Option 2: Step by step
uv run scripts/parse_results.py
uv run scripts/accumulate_mistakes.py
```

Then review your mistakes:
```bash
cat mistakes_log.md              # See all mistakes chronologically
cat mistakes_by_category.md      # See which topics need work
```

## Example Output
